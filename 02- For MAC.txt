There's no big difference between Windows and MAC, you will follow same steps except one simple thing about System.setProperty
try one of the following Methods to handle System.setProperty


Method 1 

1- You will download chrome driver as usual and save it inside any folder

2- to get the full path of chrome driver you need to right click on it and select "Get info" then "Where"

3- Copy this path and don't forget to write the driver name from "Name & Exetension"
 move it as it's inside System.setProperty in your code 

example: 
System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver","/Users/khaled/Downloads/chromedriver");

4- Open Finder > System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Under General 
you should click on the lock button at the bottom left "Click the lock to make changes"

after that
click on "Allow Anyway" beside this message
"chromedriver" was blocked from use because it is not from an identified  developer.



Notes: 
* you don't have to write machine name before /Users
* chromedriver without .exe (unlike Windows)
* don't forget to write small and captial letters as it's 
* slashes is /  (unlike Windows \\)

Method 2

1- In MAC, go to this directory /usr/local/

2- Check if there's a folder called 'bin' inside or not 
if not created, you could easily create this 'bin' folder

3- you have to copy your drivers in /usr/local/bin

4- in your code, you don't have to use System.setProperty unlike Windows


so your code will be like this 

 public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
	
	// No need to use System.setProperty if you're using MAC

 WebDriver driver=new ChromeDriver();
 
 driver.manage().window().maximize();

 driver.get("https://google.com/");

}
